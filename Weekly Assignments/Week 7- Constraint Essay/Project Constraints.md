## Legal
For our project, we are planning on using primarily open-source and/or free-to-use resources, so we should not run into any issues with disputes over intellectual property or things like that. The most important legal issue for us is to responsibly handle user data. This comes in two main areas within our app: user profiles, and payment. We plan on allowing users to create profiles to store their pizza topping preferences, and if this is done using emails and/or passwords, we need to ensure that our transmissions and storage of this information is secure, so that users' logins are secret, even though they may not have any sensitive information on their accounts. In terms of payment, if we implement the ability to place orders through our app, we must make sure we do so in a secure way so as not to leak any credit card or other payment information. Leakage of personal passwords, emails, or payment information could cause legal issues with users, so we must be responsible in how we handle this information.

## Social
Done properly, our project can enhance social gatherings. By utilizing our app, event organizers and attendees can worry less about the logistics of food (which is usually just a tangential aspect of events) and more about the proceedings of their events. Of course this is applicable to any kind of event, be it social or professional, for non-profit or for-profit organizations. This means, by extension, that if we are marginally improving non-profit events, we are also assisting them in their missions.
